# React To-Do APP

https://akt-react-todo.netlify.app/

## Description 🟢

Hello everyone! The purpose of this project is to create a To-Do List via the react library. To create the list, date and content information must be entered and then the submit button must be clicked. By clicking twice on each to-do created, the to-do should be crossed out and it should be seen that it is completed. When you want to delete tasks, you can easily delete them by clicking the ix button in the upper right. Additionally, all entered tasks should be kept on localhost and the latest information should not be deleted when the page is refreshed.

### Project Planning & Management 🗺️

Epic User Story: Developing a React To-Do App Application 


## User Stories:

1-) As a user, I want to be able to enter the date and content information for a new task in the To-Do List interface.
2-) As a user, I expect a submit button to be available to add the entered task to the list.
3-) As a user, I want the ability to mark a task as completed by clicking on it twice, visually indicating that it has been crossed out.
4-) As a user, I want to have an option to easily delete a task by clicking the 'x' button located in the upper right corner of the task.
5-) As a user, I expect all entered tasks to be stored locally on my machine (localhost), ensuring that the latest information is retained even after refreshing the page.
